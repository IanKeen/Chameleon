## What is Chameleon?
It consists of several frameworks, the core of which are:

* **Models**: Exposes Slack model data. Slack's APIs only provide object ids in their responses, however the model layer is able to convert those into _full_ model objects. 
* **WebAPI**: Allows interaction with Slack's Web API.
* **RTMAPI**: Allows interaction with Slack's Real-time messaging API.
* **Bot**: Provides an extensible Slack bot user.

## Features
* [x] **Extensible**: `SlackService`'s can be added to provide any behaviour you need.
* [x] **Typed**: You always get to work with _full_ typed Slack model data.

# Installation
## Preparation
Whether you want to run Chameleon on OSX or Linux be sure to read through the following first:

### Swift 3
You need Swift 3 installed to contribute to or use Chameleon on OSX, I recommend using [swiftenv](https://github.com/kylef/swiftenv).

```
swiftenv install DEVELOPMENT-SNAPSHOT-2016-05-09-a
swiftenv global DEVELOPMENT-SNAPSHOT-2016-05-09-a
```

This will install the snapshot and set it as the default installation of Swift 3.

### Slack
You will need to [configure](https://my.slack.com/services/new/bot) a new bot user for your team. 
Copy the token, you will need it later.

### Heroku
If you plan to run a bot on Heroku you will need a [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) account (free is fine!) 
and also have the [Heroku Toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/) installed. 

## Running locally on OSX
* Download the latest Chameleon source and extract it
* Open a terminal window and go to the directory containing `Package.swift`
* Type `swift build`
* Type `.build/debug/app --token="<your-bot-token>"`
* Go into a default channel in your slack and say `hi @yourBot` - it should respond.

## Deploy to Heroku
* Download the latest Chameleon source and extract it
* Open a terminal window and go to the directory containing `Package.swift`
* Using the [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-command) login and create a new app.
* In the Heroku dashboard add a config variable named `TOKEN` with your slack token
* Set the buildpack `heroku buildpacks:set https://github.com/oarrabi/heroku-buildpack-swift`
* Create a file called `Procfile` and add the text: `worker: App`
* Deploy to Heroku by typing:
```
git add .
git commit -am 'depoy to heroku'
git push heroku master
```
* Once that has completed type: `heroku ps:scale worker=1`
* Go into a default channel in your slack and say `hi @yourBot` - it should respond.

## ⚠️ Work in Progress
This is a work in progress so expect improvements as well as breaking changes!

Chameleon *is* functional however there is still a lot to do before it is *complete*

* The Web and Real time messaging APIs can do _a lot_ - 
I have built support for the core/most common features but they are incomplete. 
I will add more over time until they are complete.
* Once the project reaches a v1 release the individual frameworks will be broken out. 
They all live here for now for ease of development, however, separation should be considered when contributing.

## Troubleshooting
### OpenSSL Errors on OSX
If you are unable to build/run locally due to an `openssl` error, you may need to run the following in terminal:

```
brew install openssl
brew link openssl
```


#Acknowledgement
This was my first dive into 'Server Side Swift'; 
95% of this code was done over a total of a few days but getting working in the terminal 
and then deployed to Heroku took far longer... This project would likely have ended up as 
mostly useless OSX app if it hadn't been for the teams from [Vapor](http://qutheory.io/) and [Zewo](http://www.zewo.io/)
pioneering the server side Swift movement. I am especially thankful for the help and patience of
